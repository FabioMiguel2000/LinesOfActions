## Assignment Specification

- A 2 player game to solve different versions of it, using the **Minimax Search Algorithm** with αβ cuts and its variants.
- Game Modes:
    - Human-Human
    - Human-Computer
    - Computer-Computer
- The computer will exhibit different levels of difficulty, by using different evaluation functions, different depth levels of Minimax, different successor generation ordering and/or variants of the Minimax algorithm:
    - Easy 
    - Medium 
    - Hard 
- On Computer-Computer game mode, results will be saved and analysed namely:
    - Wins
    - Draws
    - Losses
    - Number of plays to obtain win/loss
    - Average time spent to obtain the plays

## Short Game Description

Lines of Action is a simple game that uses checkers board and pieces. Its rules were published in Sid Sackson's A Gamut of Games. There are some commercial versions available though.

The object of LoA is to get all your pieces into a single connected group. A group of pieces is connected if they occupy an unbroken chain of adjacent spaces, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
